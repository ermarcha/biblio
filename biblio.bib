  ABSTRACT =	 {Mixing video and computer-generated images is a new
                  and promising area of research for enhancing
                  reality. It can be used in all the situations when a
                  complete simulation would not be easy to
                  implement. Past work on the subject has relied for a
                  large part on human intervention at key moments of
                  the composition. In this paper, we show that if
                  enough geometric information about the environment
                  are available, then efficient tools developed in the
                  computer vision literature can be used to build a
                  highly automated augmented reality loop. We focus on
                  outdoor urban environments and present an
                  application for the visual assessment of a new
                  lighting project of the bridges of Paris.},

                  extracting local motion information. Moreover, it

                  classical gradient projection approach and we then
                  present a far more efficient method that relies on
                  the computation of motion that does not affect the
                  task achievement and ensures the avoidance
                  problem. We apply this new approach in a visual
                  servoing application and we demonstrate on various
                  real experiments the validity of the approach. }

                  results obtained to avoid these drawbacks. It
                  consists in combining visual features obtained

                  derivation method we present is based on Green's
                  theorem. We apply this general result to classical
                  geometrical primitives. We then consider using
                  moments in image-based visual servoing. For that, we
                  select six combinations of moments to control the
                  six degrees of freedom of the system. These features
                  are particularly adequate if we consider a planar
                  object and the configurations such that the object
                  and camera planes are parallel at the desired
                  position. The experimental results we present show
                  that a correct behavior of the system is obtained if
                  we consider either a simple symmetrical object or a

                  redundancy resolution technique must deal with the

                  singularities. The aim of this paper is
                  twofold. First, the application of existing
                  singularity-robust methods to the case of
                  kinematically redundant arms is studied. Then, a new
                  task-priority redundancy resolution technique is
                  developed that overcomes the effects of algorithmic
                  singularities. Computational aspects of the
                  solutions are also considered in view of real-time
                  implementation of a kinematic control algorithm. The
                  method is applied to a seven-degree-of-freedom
                  manipulator in numerical case studies to demonstrate
                  its effectiveness },

                  measurements-via a set of fair samples, which are

                  with the important issues of reliability and
                  robustness. In order to address this issue a closed
                  loop control law is presented that simultaneously
                  accomplishes a visual servoing task and is robust to
                  a general class of external errors. This generality
                  allows concurrent consideration of a wide range of
                  errors including: noise from image feature
                  extraction, small scale errors in the tracking and
                  even large scale errors in the matching between
                  current and desired features. This is achieved with
                  the application of widely accepted statistical
                  techniques of robust M-estimation. The M-estimator
                  is integrated by an iteratively re-weighted
                  method. The Median Absolute Deviation is used as an
                  estimate of the standard deviation of the inlier
                  data and is compared with other methods. This
                  combination is advantageous because of its high
                  efficiency, high breakdown point and desirable
                  influence functions. The robustness and stability of
                  the control law is shown to be dependent on a
                  subsequent measure of position
                  uncertainty. Furthermore the convergence criteria of
                  the control law are investigated. Experimental
                  results are presented which demonstrate visual
                  servoing tasks which resist severe outlier
                  contamination. }

                  where real-time applications are being considered
                  and needed. At the same time it is important that
                  synthetic elements are rendered and aligned in the
                  scene in an accurate and visually acceptable way. In
                  order to address these issues a real-time, robust
                  and efficient 3{D} model-based tracking algorithm is
                  proposed for a 'video see through' monocular vision
                  system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts
                  to calculating the pose between the camera and the
                  objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into
                  the scene using the pose. Here, non-linear pose
                  computation is formulated by means of a virtual
                  visual servoing approach. In this context, the
                  derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices
                  are given for different features including lines,
                  circles, cylinders and spheres. A local moving edges
                  tracker is used in order to provide real-time
                  tracking of points normal to the object contours. A
                  method is proposed for combining local position
                  uncertainty and global pose uncertainty in an
                  efficient and accurate way by propagating
                  uncertainty. Robustness is obtained by integrating a
                  M-estimator into the visual control law via an
                  iteratively re-weighted least squares
                  implementation. The method presented in this paper
                  has been validated on several complex image
                  sequences including outdoor environments. Results
                  show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes
                  in illumination and miss-tracking.},

                  is introduced for visual tracking of parametric
                  non-rigid multi-body objects. It is based on an
                  a-priori model of the object including a general
                  mechanical link description. The objective equation
                  is defined in the object-based coordinate system and
                  non-linear minimization relates to the movement of
                  the object and not the camera. This results in
                  simultaneously estimating all degrees of freedom
                  between the object s last known position relative to
                  its previous position as well as internal
                  articulated parameters. A new kinematic-set
                  formulation takes into account that articulated
                  degrees of freedom are directly observable from the
                  camera and therefore their estimation does not need
                  to pass via a kinematicchain back to the root. By
                  doing this the tracking techniques are efficient and
                  precise leading to real-time performance and
                  accurate measurements. The system is locally based
                  upon an accurate modeling of a distance criteria. A
                  general method is derived for defining any type of
                  mechanical link and experimental results show
                  prismatic, rotational and helicoidal type links. A
                  statistical M-estimation technique is applied to
                  improve robustness. A monocular camera system was
                  used as a real-time sensor to verify the theory. },

                  visual servoing approach. In this context, the
                  derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices
                  are given for different 3D geometrical primitives
                  including straight lines, circles, cylinders and
                  spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in
                  order to provide real-time tracking of points normal
                  to the object contours.  Robustness is obtained by
                  integrating a M-estimator into the visual control
                  law via an iteratively re-weighted least squares
                  implementation. This approach is then extended to
                  address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem.
                  The method presented in this paper has been
                  validated on several complex image sequences
                  including outdoor environments.  Results show the
                  method to be robust to occlusion, changes in
                  illumination and miss-tracking.}

                  real-time visual tracking of a class of articulated
                  non-rigid objects in 3D. The main contribution of
                  this paper consists in symmetrically modeling the
                  motion and velocity of an articulated object via a
                  novel kinematic set approach. This is likened to a
                  Lagrange-d'Alembert formulation in classical
                  physics. The advantages of this new model over
                  pre-existing methods include improved precision,
                  robustness and efficiency, leading to real-time
                  performance. Furthermore, a general class of
                  mechanical joints can be considered and the method
                  can track objects where previous approaches have
                  failed due to a lack of visual information. In
                  summary, a joint configuration is modeled by using
                  Pfaffian velocity constraints. The configuration and
                  location of a joint is then used to build a general
                  Jacobian Matrix which relates individual rigid body
                  velocities(twists) to an underlying minimal
                  subspace. A closed loop control law is then derived
                  in order to minimize a set of distance errors in the
                  image and estimate the system parameters. The
                  tracking is locally based upon efficient distance
                  criterion. Experimental results show prismatic,
                  rotational and helical type links and up to eight
                  general parameters. A statistical M-estimation
                  technique is applied to improve robustness. A
                  monocular camera system was used as a real-time
                  sensor to verify the theory.}

  abstract =	 { This paper presents a new application for
                  image-based visual servoing: computer graphics
                  animation. Indeed, the control of a virtual camera
                  in virtual environment is not a trivial problem and
                  usually required skilled operators. Visual servoing,
                  a now well known technique in robotics and computer
                  vision, consists in positioning a camera according
                  to the informations perceived in the images. Using
                  this method within computer graphics context leads
                  to a very intuitive approach of
                  animation. Furthermore, in that case a full
                  knowledge about the scene is available. It allows to
                  easily introduce constraints within the control law
                  in order to react automatically to modifications of
                  the environment. In this paper, we apply this
                  approach in two different contexts: highly reactive
                  applications (virtual reality, video games) and the
                  control of humanoid avatars.}

                  computer graphics field, simulating virtual humans
                  has become a challenging task. Animating such an
                  autonomous actor within a virtual environment

                  information to provide visually interesting targets

                  motion estimation based on mutual information and
                  its use in video mosaicing applications. Sum of
                  Squared Differences (SSD) is widely considered in
                  motion estimation. Here, we consider another metric
                  widely considered in medical imaging, Mutual
                  Information (MI), which is far less sensitive to
                  changes in the lighting condition, to occlusions,
                  and to a wide class of non-linear image
                  transformation. Mosaicing results for various image
                  sequences acquired under various complex conditions
                  are finally presented.}

  annote =	 {We present a new approach for modeling and rendering
                  existing architectural scenes from a sparse set of
                  still photographs. Our modeling approach, which
                  combines both geometry-based and image-based
                  techniques, has two components. The first component
                  is a photogrammetric modeling method which
                  facilitates the recovery of the basic geometry of
                  the photographed scene. Our photogrammetric modeling
                  approach is effective, convenient, and robust
                  because it exploits the constraints that are
                  characteristic of architectural scenes. The second
                  component is a model-based stereo algorithm, which
                  recovers how the real scene deviates from the basic
                  model. By making use of the model, our stereo
                  technique robustly recovers accurate depth from
                  widely-spaced image pairs. Consequently, our
                  approach can model large architectural environments
                  with far fewer photographs than current image-based
                  modeling approaches. For producing renderings, we
                  present view-dependent texture mapping, a method of
                  compositing multiple views of a scene that better
                  simulates geometric detail on basic models. Our
                  approach can be used to recover models for use in
                  either geometry-based or image-based rendering
                  systems. We present results that demonstrate our
                  approach's ability to create realistic renderings of
                  architectural scenes from viewpoints far from the
                  original photographs. }

  journal =	 {J. Appl. Mechanics},
  month =	 jun,
  volume =	 22,
  pages =	 {215--221},
  asbtract =	 {Reuleaux [1875] attempted to formalize a symbolic
                  notation for spatial mechanisms but he did not
                  include all the variables needed for a complete
                  kinematic description of the mechanism, and it is in
                  this classic paper that a kinematically complete
                  symbolic notation is evolved. Spatial mechanisms
                  with only lower pairs (surface contact) are
                  considered. The substance of this notation continues
                  to this day. The main contribution of this paper
                  lies in the system for selecting successive link
                  coordinates which makes the transformation across a
                  joint the function of only four parameters. This is
                  a reflection of the fact that the spatial
                  relationship between any two lines in space can be
                  expressed as a sequence of two screws (a screw =
                  translation and rotation about the same line). For
                  easy computer implementation, homogeneous
                  coordinates and 4x4 matrices are used to represent
                  the coordinate transformations across each
                  joint. The matrices for prismatic (sliding) and
                  revolute rotating joints are formulated. The
                  Denavit-Hartenberg link coordinate assignments were
                  refined further by Sheth and Uicker [1971] who
                  extended the notation to cover the entire range of
                  mechanisms including higher pairs (point or line
                  contact).},

  abstract =	 {The use of a camera in a robot control loop can be
                  performed with two types of architecture: the camera
                  is said eye-in-hand when rigidly mounted on the
                  robot end-effector and it is said eye-to-hand when
                  it observes the robot within its work space. These
                  two schemes have technical differences and they can
                  play very complementary parts. Obviously, the
                  eye-in-hand one has a partial but precise sight of
                  the scene whereas the eye-to-hand camera has a less
                  precise but global sight of it. The motivation of
                  our work is to take advantage of both, free-standing
                  and robot-mounted sensors, in a cooperation
                  scheme. The system we present in this paper performs
                  two separate tasks: a positioning one that is
                  ensured in the global image and a tracking one
                  performed in the local image. For robustness
                  considerations, the control law stability is proved
                  and several cooperative schemes are studied and
                  compared in experimental results. }

  abstract =	 {Estimating the pose of a camera (virtual or real) in
                  which some augmentation takes place is one of the
                  most important parts of an augmented reality (AR)
                  system. Availability of powerful processors and fast
                  frame grabber shave made vision-based trackers
                  commonly used due to their accuracy as well as
                  flexibility and ease of use. Current vision-based
                  trackers are based on tracking of markers. The use
                  of markers increases robustness and reduces
                  computational requirements. However, their use can
                  be very complicated, as they require certain
                  maintenance. Direct use of scene features for
                  tracking, therefore, is desirable. To this end, we
                  describe a general system that tracks the position
                  and orientation of a camera observing a scene
                  without any visual markers. Our method is base on a
                  two-stage process. In the first stage, a set of
                  features is learned with the help of an external
                  tracking system while in action. The second stage
                  uses these learned features for camera tracking when
                  the system in the first stage decides that it is
                  possible to do so. The system is very general so
                  that it can employ any available feature tracking
                  and pose estimation system for learning and
                  tracking. We experimentally demonstrate the
                  viability of the method in real-life examples.},

  abstract =	 {In this paper we demonstrate that all single
                  viewpoint catadioptric projections are equivalent to
                  the composition of central projection to the sphere
                  followed by a point projection from the sphere to an
                  image plane. Special cases of this equivalence are
                  parabolic projection, for which the second map is a
                  stereographic projection, and perspective
                  projection, for which the second map is central
                  projection. We also show that two projections are
                  dual by the mapping which takes conics to their
                  foci. The foci of line images are points of another,
                  dual, catadiotpric projection; and vice versa,
                  points in the image-are foci of lines in the dual
                  projection. They are dual because the mapping
                  preserves incidence relationships. Finally we show
                  some applications of the theory presented above. We
                  present a general algorithm for calibration of a
                  catadioptric system with lines in a single view}

  abstract =	 {Most models of visual search, whether involving
                  overt eye movements or covert shifts of attention,
                  are based on the concept of a saliency map, that is,
                  an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the
                  saliency or conspicuity of objects in the visual
                  environment. Competition among neurons in this map
                  gives rise to a single winning location that
                  corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting
                  this location automatically allows the system to
                  attend to the next most salient location. We
                  describe a detailed computer implementation of such
                  a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining
                  information across modalities, here orientation,
                  intensity and color information, in a purely
                  stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to
                  common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very
                  demanding visual search task. Its successful
                  performance is used to address the extent to which
                  the primate visual system carries out visual search
                  via one or more such saliency maps and how this can
                  be tested.},

  abstract =	 {We describe a neurobiological model of visual
                  attention and eye/head movements in primates, and
                  its application to the automatic animation of a
                  realistic virtual human head watching an
                  unconstrained variety of visual inputs. The
                  bottom-up (image-based) attention model is based on
                  the known neurophysiology of visual processing along
                  the occipito-parietal pathway of the primate brain,
                  while the eye/head movement model is derived from
                  recordings in freely behaving Rhesus monkeys. The
                  system is successful at autonomously saccading
                  towards and tracking salient targets in a variety of
                  video clips, including synthetic stimuli, real

                  solves T-world problems, a class of problems
                  involving static two-dimensional scenes. For
                  example, TEA-1 has been demonstrated to answer
                  questions about scenes of dinner tables. .pp This
                  paper presents dTEA-1, an extension to TEA-1 that
                  allows tasks to be performed on dynamic
                  scenes. Currently, dTEA-1 successfully performs a
                  task on a simulated train scene. The objects in the
                  scene include a train on a track and a herd of cows,
                  but the domain may be extended to include static
                  objects and other classifications of moving
                  objects. The task is to keep track of the locations
                  of objects, and the system intelligently allocates
                  its effort to keep uncertainty and cost to a
                  minimum.}

  abstract =	 {In this paper we address the visual servoing of
                  planar robot manipulators under fixed-camera
                  configuration. The control goal is to place the
                  robot end-effector over a desired static target by
                  using a vision system equipped with a fixed camera
                  to `see' the robot end-effector and target. We
                  analyze an image-based controller, whose
                  implementation requires the robot Jacobian, the
                  gravitational torque vector, and the camera
                  orientation. Further, the robot manipulator is not
                  treated as an ideal positioning device but modeled
                  by the Lagrangian dynamics. We formally prove that
                  the overall closed-loop system composed by the full
                  nonlinear robot dynamics and the controller is
                  Lyapunov stable. Also, we demonstrate that the
                  controller is capable to yield an asymptotically
                  stable system which is robust against radial lens
                  distortions and uncertainty in the camera
                  orientation. Simulations on a two degrees of freedom
                  arm are presented to illustrate the controller
                  performance}

  abstract =	 {For service robots operating in domestic
                  environments, it is not enough to consider only
                  control level robustness; it is equally important to
                  consider how image information that serves as input
                  to the control process can be used so as to achieve
                  robust and efficient control. In this paper we
                  present an effort towards the development of robust
                  visual techniques used to guide robots in various
                  tasks. Given a task at hand, we argue that different
                  levels of complexity should be considered; this also
                  defines the choice of the visual technique used to
                  provide the necessary feedback information. We
                  concentrate on visual feedback estimation where we
                  investigate both two- and three-dimensional
                  techniques. In the former case, we are interested in
                  providing coarse information about the object
                  position/velocity in the image plane. In particular,
                  a set of simple visual features (cues) is employed
                  in an integrated framework where voting is used for
                  fusing the responses from individual cues. The
                  experimental evaluation shows the system performance
                  for three different cases of camera-robot
                  configurations most common for robotic systems. For
                  cases where the robot is supposed to grasp the
                  object, a two- dimensional position estimate is
                  often not enough. Complete pose (position and
                  orientation) of the object may be
                  required. Therefore, we present a model-based system
                  where a wire-frame model of the object is used to
                  estimate its pose. Since a number of similar systems
                  have been proposed in the literature, we concentrate
                  on the particular part of the system usually
                  neglected?automatic pose initialization. Finally, we
                  show how a number of existing approaches can
                  successfully be integrated in a system that is able
                  to recognize and grasp fairly textured, everyday
                  objects. One of the examples presented in the
                  experimental section shows a mobile robot performing
                  tasks in a real-word environment. },

  abstract =	 {We consider typical manipulation tasks in terms of a
                  service robot framework. Given a task at hand, such
                  as "Pick up the cup from the dinner table", we
                  present a number of different visual systems
                  required to accomplish the task. A standard robot
                  platform with a PUMA560 on the top is used for
                  experimental evaluation. The classical
                  approach-align-grasp idea is used to design a
                  manipulation system. Here, both visual and tactile
                  feedback is used to accomplish the given task. In
                  terms of image processing, we start by a recognition
                  system which provides a 2{D} estimate of the object
                  position in the image. Thereafter, a 2{D} tracking
                  system is presented and used to maintain the object
                  in the field of view during an approach stage. For
                  the alignment stage, two systems are available. The
                  first is a model based tracking system that
                  estimates the complete pose/velocity of the
                  object. The second system is based on corner
                  matching and estimates homography between two
                  images. In terms of tactile feedback, we present a
                  grasping system that, at this stage, performs power
                  grasps. The main objective here is to compensate for
                  minor errors in object position/orientation estimate
                  caused by the vision system.},

                  has become a popular form of networked virtual
                  reality. However, it is still a great challenge for
                  a novice user equipped with a regular desktop PC to
                  navigate in most virtual worlds of moderate
                  complexity. We think the main problem is due to the
                  fact that a user usually uses a 2{D} mouse to
                  provide low-level navigation control but the display
                  frame rate is not high enough for this servo
                  loop. We consider an alternative metaphor of
                  allowing a user to specify locations of interests on
                  a 2{D}-layout map and let the system automatically
                  generate the animation of guided tours in virtual
                  architectural environments. Specifically, we aim to
                  generate animations of customizable tour paths and
                  its associated human/camera motions in an on-line
                  manner according to high-level user inputs. We
                  describe an auto-navigation system, in which several
                  efficient path-planning algorithms adapted from
                  robotics are used. This system has been implemented
                  in Java and adopts common VRML browsers as its 3{D}
                  interface. We also use the geometric model of our
                  departmental building as an example to demonstrate
                  the efficiency and effectiveness of the system}

                  Rectification of Patches (DARP), which exploits
                  depth information available in RGB-D consumer
                  devices to improve keypoint matching of
                  perspectively distorted images. This is achieved by
                  generating a projective rectification of a patch
                  around the keypoint, which is normalized with
                  respect to perspective distortions and scale. The
                  DARP method runs at interactive rates and can be
                  used with any local feature detector and
                  descriptor. The evaluation of the method with planar
                  and non-planar scenes shows that DARP can obtain
                  better results than existing keypoint matching
                  approaches. }

  abstract =	 {A computer vision system has been implemented that
                  can recognize three-dimensional objects from unknown
                  viewpoints in single gray-scale images. Unlike most
                  other approaches, the recognition is accomplished
                  without any attempt to reconstruct depth information
                  bottom-up from the visual input. Instead, three
                  other mechanisms are used that can bridge the gap
                  between the two-dimensional image and knowledge of
                  three-dimensional objects. First, a process of
                  perceptual organization is used to form groupings
                  and structures in the image that are likely to be
                  invariant over a wide range of viewpoints. Second, a
                  probabilistic ranking method is used to reduce the
                  size of the search space during model-based
                  matching. Finally, a process of spatial
                  correspondence brings the projections of
                  three-dimensional models into direct correspondence
                  with the image by solving for unknown viewpoint and
                  model parameters. A high level of robustness in the
                  presence of occlusion and missing data can be
                  achieved through full application of a viewpoint
                  consistency constraint. It is argued that similar
                  mechanisms and constraints form the basis for
                  recognition in human vision.},

                  uncertainties on the depths of the observed
                  object. In the recent past, research on image-based
                  visual servoing has been concentrated on potential
                  problems of stability and on robustness with respect
                  to camera calibration errors. Only little attention,
                  if any, has been devoted to the robustness of
                  image-based visual servoing to depth estimation
                  errors. It is generally believed that a rough
                  approximation of the depth distribution is
                  sufficient to ensure the stability of the control
                  law. In this paper, we prove that the robustness
                  domain is not so wide and that an extreme care must
                  be taken when approximating the depth distribution.}

                  methods are classified following an analogy with
                  well known minimization methods. Comparing the rate
                  of convergence between minimization algorithms helps
                  us to understand the difference of performance of
                  the control schemes. In particular, it is shown that
                  standard vision-based control methods have in
                  general low rates of convergence. Thus, the
                  performance of vision-based control could be
                  improved using schemes which perform like the Newton
                  minimization algorithm that has a high convergence
                  rate. Unfortunately, the Newton minimization method
                  needs the computation of second derivatives that can
                  be ill-conditioned causing convergence problems. For
                  these reasons, two new control schemes with high
                  convergence rates are proposed in this paper.}

                  one in the 3{D} space. The first step is able to

                  estimated by a robust statistical method. Then, we
                  refine the localization of the object silhouette by
                  evaluating the 3{D} parameters related to the object
                  pose by the iteratively minimizing a nonlinear cost

  abstract =	 { This paper presents a new formulation for the
                  camera calibration problem. We propose a method
                  based on the well known visual servoing approach. We
                  consider pose computation and lens calibration as
                  the dual problem of visual servoing. It allows to
                  take advantage of all the research that have been
                  carried out in this domain in the past. The proposed
                  method features simplicity, accuracy, efficiency,
                  and scalability wrt. to the camera model as well as
                  wrt. to the features extracted from the image. }

                  général permettant de résoudre les problèmes
                  suivants : positionner une caméra par rapport à son
                  environnement et réagir de manière adaptée à des
                  modifications de celui-ci. La méthode proposée
                  repose sur une technique issue de la robotique et de
                  la vision par ordinateur : l'asservissement
                  visuel. Cette approche permet de générer
                  automatiquement des mouvements 3{D} de la caméra à
                  partir d'une tâche spécifiée dans l'image. La
                  possibilité de prendre en compte de manière
                  dynamique et en temps-réel des modifications de
                  l'environnement découle de l'utilisation de
                  contraintes intégrées dans les lois de commande
                  considérées. Cette approche est ainsi adaptée à des
                  contextes hautement réactifs (réalité virtuelle,

  abstract =	 { In this article, the problem of real-time hybrid
                  contour/texture tracking for planar objects is
                  addressed. On one hand, a lot of methods have been
                  proposed to track objects from their contours. On
                  the other hand, numerous other tracking algorithms
                  deal with texture. In real situations, objects tan
                  unfortunately rarely be divided so
                  clearly. Therefore, an hybrid tracking approach,
                  able to mix texture and contour information, appears
                  to be very useful. The proposed approach is very
                  simple and efficient. It is based on image
                  differences, which are the differences between
                  object aspects in the image and aspects predicted
                  using a parametric transformation model. Knowing a
                  difference image, the proposed algorithm only need a
                  matrix multiplication to estimate motion
                  parameters. This is possible due to the use of an
                  off-line learning stage.}

                  central catadioptric systems. Most of the effort in
                  visual servoing are devoted to points, only few
                  works have investigated the use of lines in visual
                  servoing with traditional cameras and none has
                  explored the case of omnidirectional cameras. First
                  a generic interaction matrix for the projection of
                  3D straight lines is derived from the projection
                  model of the entire class of central catadioptric
                  cameras. Then an image-based control law is designed
                  and validated through simulation results.},

                  objects into the real image or video sequences, one
                  key issue is to keep the geometric consistency
                  between the real and virtual objects. This is
                  achieved by using the camera parameters recovered
                  from the real image to render the virtual objects.
                  Camera parameters' recovery is a basic problem in
                  the area of computer vision. On the other hand,
                  rendering is the major concern of computer
                  graphics. Ususally in these two areas different
                  image formation pipelines are used. This paper
                  presents a side-by-side comparison between the
                  pipelines, in order to make it easier to setup the
                  recovered camera parameters to do the rendering for
                  AR applications. Some experiment results are shown
                  to verify the correctness of the analysis.}

  abstract =	 {In contrast to the traditional approach, visual
                  recognition is formulated as one of matching
                  appearance rather than shape. For any given robot
                  vision task, all possible appearance variations
                  define its visual workspace. A set of images is
                  obtained by coarsely sampling the workspace. The
                  image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional
                  subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the visual
                  workspace is represented as a continuous appearance
                  manifold. Given an unknown input image, the
                  recognition system first projects the image to
                  eigenspace. The parameters of the vision task are
                  recognized based on the exact location of the
                  projection on the appearance manifold. An efficient
                  algorithm for finding the closest manifold point is
                  described. The proposed appearance representation
                  has several applications in robot vision. As
                  examples, a precise visual positioning system, a
                  real-time visual tracking system, and a real-time
                  temporal inspection system are described}

                  large forklift type robotic vehicle which operates
                  in a mainly outdoor industrial setting. The
                  localiser uses a sparse 3D-edge-map of the
                  environment and a particle filter to estimate the
                  pose of the vehicle. The vehicle operates in dynamic
                  and non-uniform outdoor lighting conditions, an
                  issue that is addressed by using knowledge of the
                  scene to intelligently adjust the camera exposure
                  and hence improve the quality of the information in
                  the image. Results from the industrial vehicle are
                  shown and compared to another laser-based localiser
                  which acts as a ground truth. An improved likelihood
                  metric, using per-edge calculation, is presented and
                  has shown to be 40\% more accurate in estimating
                  rotation. Visual localization results from the
                  vehicle driving an arbitrary 1.5km path during a
                  bright sunny period show an average position error
                  of 0.44m and rotation error of 0.62deg.},

                  augmented reality (AR) applications. Their
                  registration can be very accurate, and there is no
                  delay between the motions of real and virtual scene
                  elements. However, vision-based tracking often
                  suffers from limited range, intermittent errors, and
                  dropouts. These shortcomings are due to the need to
                  see multiple calibrated features or fiducials in
                  each frame. To address these shortcomings, features
                  in the scene can be dynamically calibrated and pose
                  calculations can be made robust to noise and
                  numerical instability. In this paper, we survey
                  classic vision-based pose computations and present
                  two methods that offer increased robustness and
                  accuracy in the context of real-time AR tracking.}

                  and 3D cues for monocular 3D tracking. The
                  integration of texture information in a more
                  classical non-linear edge-based pose computation
                  highly increases the reliability of more
                  conventional edge-based 3D tracker.  Robustness is
                  enforced by integrating a M-estimator into the
                  minimization process via an iteratively re-weighted
                  least squares implementation. The method presented

                  real-time Bayesian sampling framework. We develop a
                  robust tracker by carefully designing the particle
                  filter observation model: grouping line segments
                  from a known model into 3D junctions and performing
                  fast inlier/outlier counts on projected junction
                  branches. Results demonstrate the ability to track
                  full 3D pose in dense clutter whilst using a minimal
                  number of junctions.},

                  actors at a high level based on the concept of
                  synthetic vision. The objective is simple: to create
                  an animation involving a synthetic actor
                  automatically moving in a corridor avoiding objects
                  and other synthetic actors. To simulate this
                  behavior, each synthetic actor uses a synthetic
                  vision as its perception of the world and so as the
                  unique input to its behavioral model. This model is
                  based on the concept of displacement local automata
                  (DLA), which is similar to the concept of a script
                  for natural language processing. A DLA is an
                  algorithm that can deal with a specific
                  environment. Two DLAs, called `follow-the-corridor'
                  and `avoid-the-obstacle', are described in detail.}

  abstract =	 {Visual feedback can play a crucial role in a dynamic
                  robotic task such as the interception of a moving
                  target. To utilize the feedback effectively, there
                  is a need to develop robot motion planning
                  techniques that also take into account properties of
                  the sensed data. We propose a motion planning
                  framework that achieves this with the help of a
                  space called the perceptual control manifold (PCM)
                  defined on the product of the robot configuration
                  space and an image-based feature space. We show how
                  the task of intercepting a moving target can be
                  mapped to the PCM, using image feature trajectories
                  of the robot end-effector and the moving
                  target. This leads to the generation of motion plans
                  that satisfy various constraints and optimality
                  criteria derived from the robot kinematics, the
                  control system, and the sensing mechanism. Specific
                  interception tasks are analyzed to illustrate this
                  vision-based planning technique },

                  data can be compressed before processing; in the

                  each sensor are statistically independent, the data
                  compression method is shown to be computationally
                  most efficient, followed by the sequential

                  the fine structure of the original motion. Motion
                  clips are combined by overlapping and blending of

                  captured motion sequence using only a few keyframes
                  to specify the motion warp. Our technique makes it

  abstract =	 {Visual markers are widely used in existing augmented
                  reality (AR) applications [7,12,11,19 ]. In most of
                  such applications, the performance of an AR system
                  depends highly on the tracking system for visual
                  marker detection, tracking,and pose
                  estimation. Currently, there are more than one
                  marker based tracking/calibration systems
                  available. It is thus desirable for the user to know
                  which marker tracking system is likely to perform
                  the best for a specific AR application. To this
                  purpose, we compare several marker systems all using
                  planar square coded visual markers. We present the
                  evaluation results, both qualitatively and
                  quantitatively, for the following properties: the
                  usability, efficiency, accuracy, and
                  reliability. For a particular AR application, there
                  are different marker detection and tracking
                  requirements. Therefore, the purpose of this work is
                  not to rank the existing marker systems; instead, we
                  try to analyze the strength and weakness of various
                  aspects of the marker tracking systems and provide
                  the AR application developers with this
                  information.}
